Agile Methodology


=>The Agile methodology is a collection of principles that value adaptability and flexibility. Agile  aims to provide better responsiveness to changing business needs and therefore focuses on enabling teams to deliver in workable increments.

 . Working software over comprehensive documentation 
 . Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
 . Responding to change over following a plan
